# The KeyWI
An expressive and accessible electronic wind instrument

The KeyWI is a new electronic wind instrument that offers the expressiveness and portability of a melodica with the vastly increased flexibility and versatility of an electronic system. The instrument features intuitive polyphony as well as improvements in transient response, dynamic range, and sensing nuances in breath pressure.
